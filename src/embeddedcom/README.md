# welcome


after unpacking correctly you should notice that some interrupts are called (obfuscated though!)
this code is just taking the first byte of the mounted floppy image (it expects it to be a standard MS-DOS formatted floppy)
and expects an IRET instruction to be in the int 3 interrupt vector entry (will fail under dosbox unless you patch it, there's an example patchint3.s here!

when this conditions are met (silly floppy copy protection and antidebug) it will correctly decrypt the embedded keygen gzip)

searching for useful info?
